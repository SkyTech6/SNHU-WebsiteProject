	<p>
		Train Your Minibot is our studio's largest project. In 2017 we participated in a one week game jam where we took
		a concept and created a rapid prototype. The prototype had achieved a high ranking in multiple categories during
		the jam; enough in fact for us to invest about a year and a half turning this MVP into a full fledged game that
		will soon be available for purchase on the Steam platform.

		Where? Planet Dysphoria -- the manifestation of gender dysphoria.
		<br>
		Who? A person in their twenties experiencing dysphoria.
		<br>
		How? First-person-POV, mystery game with point and click interactions.
		<br>
	</p>

	<p>
		Planet Dysphoria was a game we had created over a one week period as a rapid prototype. It was meant to dispaly
		a very specific set of functionality and all of that was achieved as well a full multiple track OST.
