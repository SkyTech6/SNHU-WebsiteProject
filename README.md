# SNHU-WebsiteProject
I decided to take an elective course towards the end of my Computer Science degree to take a look into learning the foundations of front-end web development. This is the website project that I've created while taking Southern New Hampshire University's IT-270 Web Site Design course. As well the site is being hosted directly to GitHub Pages, of which the link can be found on the sidebar.
