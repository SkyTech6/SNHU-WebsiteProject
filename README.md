# SNHU-WebsiteProject
I decided to take an elective course towards the end of my Computer Science degree to take a look into learning the foundations of front-end web development. This is the website project that I've created while taking Southern New Hampshire University's IT-270 Web Site Design course. As well the site is being hosted directly to GitHub Pages, of which the link can be found on the sidebar. 

### Branches
The branches on this project are not feature branches of the final project. They are simply the assignments performed during the course, this is primarily for archival reasons and easily keep my workflow in the class efficently.
